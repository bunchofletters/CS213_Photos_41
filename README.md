MOVING IMAGE: 
    
    If you want to move an image, select the image first and then click on the album you want to move it to. If you try moving into an album with the same image, it will do nothing and reset your selection, so you just have to click on it again if you want to RE-move it somewhere else. IF THE BUTTON DOES NOTHING WHEN CLICKED, NO IMAGE IS SELECTED.


COPYING AND PASTING: 
    
    When you click the copy button on an image, it is saved until you paste it into an album. However, if the copied photo is already in the album, the copy will still be saved. When you successfully paste something into an album, the copy button becomes empty. SO YOU CAN ONLY PASTE ONE COPIED IMAGE AT A TIME.
